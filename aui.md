# AUI

- Adaptive User Interface: 
  - Step 1: Abstract Model - Finite State Machines 
  - Step 2: Analytics (flow and actions)

Use shortest path alogirthms to analyse which path to take in a weighted graph -> likelihood of user to travel from A to C 
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Higher-order Markov Models]] (also considering the past actions)
